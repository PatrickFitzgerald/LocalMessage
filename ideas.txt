Feature ideas:
	working files:
		user settings
		global user list (for friends list lookup)
		online user list (for udp connections)
	friends list:
		add friends, inform that user
		remove friends
	group chats:
		create group chats
		add users to group chats
		remove users from group chat
		remove group chats
	modes of communication (user):
		text
		images
		screen share
		video clips? since we will already have video capture figured out     
		matlab specific content (variables, figures, etc)
	modes of communication (technical):
		send message (text/image/etc) to a chat (and thus to any participating users)
		request all previous info (i.e. resume chat after crash, if other party did not crash)
	export messages:
		export whole conversations as text
		save images
	customization:
		display names
		avatar stand-in (we don't have profile pictures)
			user selected color
			user selected initials to display over their selected color     
	message content:
		sender username
		timestamp
		content type
		content
	diagnostics:
		offer users (developers) to see the actions the app is
		performing at that moment.
		incorporate logger messages
		upload/download rates, totals
		number of active udp agents
	remote force app shutdown:
		if we need to update the app, and possibly someone is still
		logged into it, the file will be locked (since there's only
		one install)... we need a way to forcibly shut down all apps.
		maybe save their chat state, close all related objects, reset
		path, wait 30 mins, and restart app, restore state.

Prospective features
	Set figure icon
		iconFilename = 'C:\Users\Patrick\Desktop\Local Message App\resources\test.png';
		jIcon = javax.swing.ImageIcon(iconFilename);
		j = get(mainFigure,'JavaFrame');
		j.setFigureIcon(jIcon)
